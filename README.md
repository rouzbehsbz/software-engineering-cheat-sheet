# Software Engineering

These are my personal notes and patterns on software architecture and system design, accumulated over years of experience, books and articles I have read.
I thought it might be good to start with explaining some concepts before diving into more detailed stuff.

## There is no one-size-fits-all solution
Keep in mind that there is no one perfect solution for all problems and challenges. Its an important one, always remember, as an engineer you must pick a design or solution with less trade-offs for your software or overall system.
You can't achieve high maintanability for your software without sacrficing performance issues, you can't scale your software without dealing with shared resource accessability from multiple concurrent consumers.
Practice and learn different designs and patterns, and choose most efficient one for your software or system.

## Design Decision Priciples
As a software architect or system designer, you always need to achieve these priciples as much as you can when you're desicion making:

- Performance
- Scalability
- Reliability
- Maintainability
- Deployment
- Security

For me these classification makes sense the most.
